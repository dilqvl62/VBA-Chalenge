# VBA-Chalenge
Crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo have been growing in success and popularity since the late 2000s. From independent content creators to famous celebrities, more and more people are using crowdfunding to launch new products and generate buzz, but not every project has found success.

To receive funding, the project must meet or exceed an initial goal, so many organizations dedicate considerable resources looking through old projects in an attempt to discover “the trick” to finding success. For this Challenge, I will organize and analyze a database of 1,000 sample projects to uncover any hidden trends.

# Objectives
**Step 1**
 * Use conditional formatting to fill each cell in the outcome column with a different color
   * Create a new column called Percent Funded that uses a formula to find how much money a campaign made relative to its initial funding goal.
* Use conditional formatting to fill each cell in the Percent Funded column according to a three-color scale.
   * Create a new column called Average Donation that uses a formula to find how much each project backer paid on average.
  
   * Create two new columns, one called Parent Category and another called Sub-Category, that use formulas to split the Category and Sub-Category column into the two 
   new, separate columns.
