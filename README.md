# Analyze generated stock market data.

Use VBA scripting to analyze generated stock market data.

# Dataset

[Stock market data](https://github.com/dilqvl62/VBA-Chalenge/tree/main/Data)

**Use the sheet alphabetical_testing.xlsx while developing your code. This dataset is smaller and will allow you to test faster. Your code should run on this file in under 3 to 5 minutes**

# Objectives 

Use VBA scripting to analyze generated stock market data.

# Instructions 

*  Create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:

   * The ticker symbol
    
   * Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
    
   * The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
    
   * The total stock volume of the stock.

* Add functionality to the script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume".


* Add appropriate adjustments to the VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every year) at once.
