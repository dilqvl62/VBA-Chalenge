# VBA-Chalenge
Crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo have been growing in success and popularity since the late 2000s. From independent content creators to famous celebrities, more and more people are using crowdfunding to launch new products and generate buzz, but not every project has found success.

To receive funding, the project must meet or exceed an initial goal, so many organizations dedicate considerable resources looking through old projects in an attempt to discover “the trick” to finding success. For this Challenge, I will organize and analyze a database of 1,000 sample projects to uncover any hidden trends.
Creating a script in VBA that loops through all the stocks for one year.
# Dataset:
[CrowdfundingBook dataset](https://github.com/dilqvl62/VBA-Chalenge/blob/main/Data%26Output/CrowdfundingBook.xlsx)

# Objectives
**Step 1**
 * Use conditional formatting to fill each cell in the outcome column with a different color
   * Create a new column called Percent Funded.
* Use conditional formatting to fill each cell in the Percent Funded column according to a three-color scale.
   * Create a new column called Average Donation to find how much each project backer paid on average.
  
   * Create two new columns, one called Parent Category and another called Sub-Category, to split the Category and Sub-Category column into the two 
   new, separate columns.

  * Create a new sheet with a pivot table that analyzes your initial worksheet to count how many campaigns were successful, failed, canceled, or are currently live per category.
